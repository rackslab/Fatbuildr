== Authentication

Fatbuildrweb supports optional authentication, depending on the
xref:admin:web.adoc#policy[loaded policy]. The authentication is based on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token[JWT tokens]. Users can obtain a
valid token by running this command:

[source,console]
----
$ fatbuildrctl tokens generate
----

TIP: Refer to xref:usage:fatbuildrctl.adoc#tokens[`fatbuildrctl` manpage
_tokens_ section] for more details.

The tokens must be transmitted to the server as a _Bearer token_ through the
`Authorization` HTTP request header, as defined in
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750[RFC6750].

Most endpoints are associated to a
xref:admin:web.adoc#perms[_permission action_] as referenced in the
sections below. The policy defines which roles (including the _anonymous_ role)
are granted to perform these actions.

Fatbuildrweb determines the user encoded in the JWT token provided the request
headers. Then, it searches for the roles associated this user. If the request is
sent without token, the _anonymous_ role is selected. Then, Fatbuildrweb checks
one of the roles is permitted to perform the _permission action_ associated to
the endpoint. If the user is not permitted for this _permission action_, the
server responds with HTTP/403 _Forbidden_ code.
