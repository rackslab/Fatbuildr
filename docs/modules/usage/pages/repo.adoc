= Artifact Definition Reference
:j2-template: https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/

_Artifact definitions_ are required to build artifact with Fatbuildr. Artifact
definition is basically a set of artifact metadata (_ex:_ versions, checksums,
releases, etc) and build rules (_ex:_ packaging code).

This sections explains how to write these artifact definitions.

[#repository]
== Artifact Repository

While Fatbuildr can naturally be used to build only one artifact, it is also
designed to help maintaining a full set of artifacts in multiple formats in a
consistent manner. In this case, it is recommended to maintain all artifacts
definitions in one global directory designated as the _artifacts repository_.

NOTE: In Fatbuildr, artefacts definitions are designed to be composed of mostly
small text files. This makes source code management systems (such as Git)
especially appropriate to track changes in _artifacts repositories_.

In this artifacts repository, it is recommended to create one subdirectory per
artifact. This subdirectory is intended to fully contain the definition of this
artifact. For example, to maintain artifact definitions of _foo_, _bar_ and
_baz_ artifacts, create the following layout of subdirectories:

[source]
----
repository
├── foo
├── bar
└── baz
----

While this setup in recommended in Fatbuildr artifact repositories, it is just a
convention to simplify usage of xref:fatbuildrctl.adoc[] command. This layout
is not enforced. You can adopt the layout of your choice, you may just have to
provide xref:fatbuildrctl.adoc[] base directory and subdirectory options more
often.

[#def]
== Artifact Definition

An artifact definition directory are expected to contain multiple files and
directories. These are described in the following subsections.

=== Meta

An artifact definition directory must contain a definition file formatted in
YAML and named `artifact.yml`.

NOTE: As an alternative, the file can also be named `artifact.yaml`, depending
upon your preference. The filename `meta.yml` is also supported for historical
reason and it is *deprecated*.

This file can contain the following parameters:

`source`:: Remote URL of the software source archive. This URL is used to
download the software source. The value can use `{{ version }}` placeholder.
This is dynamically replaced by Fatbuildr with the target source version number
(_ex:_ `1.2.3`). This parameter is required as soon as `version`, `versions` or
`derivatives` is defined.

_Example_:::

[source,yaml]
----
source: https://download.software.org/foo-{{ version }}.tar.xz
----

NOTE: Fatbuildr natively supports all compressed tarballs (_ex:_
`{asterisk}.tar.gz`, `{asterisk}.tar.xz`) and zip files.

`sources`:: This is an alternative to `source` parameter for artifacts with
multiple sources. The value must be a hash with sources identifiers as keys and
remote URL of the software source tarball as values. The first source identifier
is considered as the main source of the artifact and must match the artifact
name.

_Example_:::

[source,yaml]
----
sources:
  foo: https://download.software.org/foo-{{ version }}.tar.xz
  bar: https://download.software.org/bar-{{ version }}.tar.xz
----

NOTE: Fatbuildr downloads the source archives targeted by these URL and fills a
cache. As long as the archive is available in the cache (typically starting from
the 2^nd^ build), Fatbuildr does not try to access the URL anymore. This notably
makes Fatbuildr resilient to resources removed on remote servers and saves
network bandwidth.

`version`:: A source version number (ex: `1.2.3`). This is the source version
used when building the artifact, as released by upstream developers. This
straightforward parameter can be used for mono-source artifacts when the
artifact is only intended to be built for default _main_ derivative. For
multi-sources artifacts, please refer to `versions` parameter. For artifacts
targeting other derivatives, please refer to `derivatives` parameter.

_Example_:::

[source,yaml]
----
version: 1.2.3
----

`versions`:: This is an alternative to `version` parameter for artifacts with
multiple sources for default _main_ derivative. For artifacts targeting other
derivatives, please refer to `derivatives` key. The value must be a hash with
sources identifiers as keys and target source version numbers as values.

_Example_:::

[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  foo: 1.2.3
  bar: 4.5.6
----

`derivatives`:: This is an alternative to `version` and `versions` parameters
for artifacts with multiple derivatives. The value must be a hash whose keys
are the targeted derivatives names. The format of values depends on the number
of artifact sources. For mono-source artifacts, the values are the version
numbers targeted for the derivative. For artifacts with multiple sources, the
values are hashes with source identifier as keys and the version number for this
source in the associated derivative as values.

_Example for mono-source artifact_:::
+
--
[source,yaml]
----
derivatives:
  foo2: 2.1.0
  foo1: 1.3.5
----
--

_Example for artifact with multiple sources_:::

derivatives:
  foo2:
    foo: 2.1.0
    bar: 4.5.6
  foo1:
    foo: 1.3.5
    bar: 4.2.1
----
--

NOTE: Either `version`, `versions` or `derivatives` parameters must be defined
in most cases, unless users want to always specify the version at build time
using the dedicated option of xref:fatbuildrctl.adoc[] `build` command (_ex:_
for sofware never released by upstream developers).

`checksums`:: The checksums of software source archives. The value is a hash
whose keys format of values depends on the number of artifact sources. For
mono-source artifacts, the keys are the version numbers (_ex:_ `1.2.3`) and the
values are hashes with hash function as keys (_ex:_ `sha256`) and the expected
hash function result as values. For artifacts with multiple sources, there is an
additional top-level key for the source identifiers.

Then, one parameter must be declared per format supported for this artifact. If
one format is not declared in this file, Fatbuildr refuses to build the artifact
in this missing format.

The formats parameters contain a hash of parameters. Each format supports a
different set of parameters:

`deb`::

`release`::: The release number of deb package, suffixed to the source version
  number to compose the package number. This parameter is required. _Ex:_ `1` or
  `2+beta1`.

`rpm`::

`release`::: The release number of deb package, suffixed with the distribution
  name to the source version number to compose the package number. This
  parameter is required. Ex: `1` or `2+beta1`.

`buildargs`::: The build arguments provided to `rpmbuild` for the spec file.
  This parameter is optional.

`osi`:: The OSI format does support any additional parameter. It must be
  declared with an empty hash (`{}`).

_Example_:::

  buildargs: --with mysql

=== Deb packages

For Deb packages, packaging code must be located in `deb/` subdirectory of
artifact definition directory. The content of this directory is basically the
content of the `debian/` subdirectory of Deb source package, with some notable
exceptions.

NOTE: When the artifact archives contains an upstream `debian/` directory, it is
automatically removed by Fatbuildr during Deb packages builds. It is replaced by
the `debian/` directory generated by Fatbuildr based on the content of `deb/`
subdirectory of artifact definition.

The `changelog` file is not required. Fatbuildr generates this file dynamically
at build time. If the artifact is already published for the targeted build
distribution. If the `changelog` file is present in `deb` subdirectory, it is
replaced by the file generated at build time.

The `patches` directory is not required. If xref:#patches[patches] are present
in artifact definition directory or if prescript produces a patch, Fatbuildr
generates the `patches` directory accordingly. If `patches` directory already
exists in `deb` subdirectory, it is replaced by the generated directory.

All files whose name is suffixed by `.j2` is considered as a
{j2-template}[Jinja2 template] and is processed to generate the same file
without the suffix. For example, `deb/control.j2` generates `deb/control`.

The following variables are available in templates:

include::partial$version-var.adoc[]

=== RPM packages

For RPM packages, a `rpm/` subdirectory must be present in artifact definition
directory. It must contain a spec file named `<artifact>.spec` where
`<artefact>` is the name of the artifact. For example, the file `rpm/foo.spec`
is expected to build RPM packages for artifact `foo`.

The spec file is processed as a Jinja2 template. The following variables are
available in the template:

`pkg`:: The artifact `ArtifactBuildRpm` object. It has many attributes such as:

`distribution`::: The name of targeted RPM distribution (_ex:_ `el8`)

`derivative`::: The name of targeted RPM distribution derivative

`architectures`::: The list of targeted CPU architectures for the build

`version`::: The artifact version, as an `ArtifactVersion` object

`env_name`::: The name of the build environment associated to the targeted RPM
distribution (_ex:_ `rocky-8`)

`tarball_url`::: The full URL to the upstream tarball (optional)

`tarball_filename`::: The filename of the uptream tarball (optional)

`version`:: The upstream version number of the software. For example, for
package version number `1.2-3.el8`, `version` is `1.2`.
+
TIP: This is a short alias for `pkg.version.main`.

`release`:: The release number of the artifact. For example, for package version
number `1.2-3.el8`, `release` is `3.el8`.
+
TIP: This is a short alias for `pkg.version.fullrelease`.

`sources`:: The `Source*` tags to declare the sources input for the RPM packages
(ex: `Source0: foo-1.2.tar.gz`).

`prep_sources`:: The `%setup` macros to declare in the `%prep` section of the
spec file.

NOTE: The `source` and `prep_sources` variables are dynamically generated by
Fatbuildr at build time and handles proper declaration of optional supplementary
tarballs generated by xref:#prescript[artifact prescript]. This provides
solution to write and maintain generic spec file compatible with all prescripts.

`patches`:: The `Patch*` to declare the upstream source patch queue. It is
generated dynamically by Fatbuildr based on optional set of
xref:#patches[artifact patches] and optional patch generated by
xref:#prescript[artifact prescript].

`prep_patches`:: The `%autopatch` macro to declare in the `%prep` section of the
spec file.

NOTE: The `patches` and `prep_patches` variables are dynamically generated by
Fatbuildr at build time including the optional set of xref:#patches[artifact
patches] and the optional patch generated by xref:#prescript[artifact
prescript]. This provides a solution to write and maintain generic spec files
compatible with all patchs queues and all prescripts.

`prep`:: Shorthand for `prep_sources` and `prep_patches` successively.

`changelog`:: The `%changelog` section of the spec file dynamically generated by
Fatbuildr at build time by concatenating the changelog of the same artifact
currently available in managed repository for the targeted distribution, or none
if absent, and the changelog entry generated with current build metadata.

The `rpm/` subdirectory can also contain plain files. These plain files are
automatically declared as additional sources (eg. `Source1`, `Source2`, etc) in
the spec file for the source RPM by the `sources` variable.

TIP: The additional plain files can be manipulated in the `%install` and
`%files` sections with pass:q[`%{_sourcedir}`] macro. For example, use
pass:q[`%{_sourcedir}/foo`] for the plain file `foo` in the `rpm/` subdirectory.
Usage of the traditional pass:q[`%{SOURCE1}`], … pass:q[`%{SOURCEn}`] macros are
not recommended as other sources can be added dynamically at build time by
Fatbuildr (_ex:_ xref:srctree.adoc#multi[multi-sources packages],
xref:#prescript[prescript tarballs], etc) and the source offset can be shifted.

=== OSI images

For mkosi OS images, an `osi/` subdirectory must be present in artifact
definition directory. It must contain a mkosi default settings file named
`<artifact>.mkosi` where `<artefact>` is the name of the artifact. For example,
the file `osi/foo.mkosi` is expected to build OS images for artifact `foo`.

The user-provided mkosi default settings file is used by Fatbuildr without
modification. Some mkosi parameters are ignored in the file, as they are
overriden at build time in `mkosi` command line. This applies to the following
parameters:

* `OutputDirectory`
* `ImageId`
* `ImageVersion`
* `Checksum`

=== Renaming Rules

Artifact definition directory can contain a file named `rename.j2` with
_renaming rules_. These renaming rules are applied at build time before all
other operations on the artifact definition directory. This feature can be
useful to maintain packaging files with generic names that are renamed depending
on artifact version.

The `rename.j2` is a plain text file formatted with one renaming rule per line.
Empty lines are ignored.

Renaming rule are formatted with the relative path to the source file within the
artifact definition directory, a space separator, and the relative path to the
destination file.

The file is processed as a Jinja2 template. The following variables are
available in the template:

include::partial$version-var.adoc[]

Example content of `rename.j2` renaming rules file:

[source,jinja2]
----
deb/foo-NM.install deb/foo-{{ version.main }}.install
deb/bar-N.install deb/bar-{{ version.major }}.install
----

[#patches]
=== Patches

:deb822-man: https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/dpkg-dev/deb822.5.en.html
:dep-3: https://dep-team.pages.debian.net/deps/dep3/

Users can develop patches to apply on external upstream sources, for additional
bug fixes or features.

WARNING: Artifact patches are used only for Deb and RPM packages artifact
formats.

These patches must be saved in the `patches/<version>/` subdirectory of the
artifact definition directory, where `<version>` is the uptream version of the
software. For example, patches for _foo_ version 1.2 must be saved into
`patches/1.2/` subdirectory of _foo_ artifact definition directory. This layout
gives the possibility to maintain patches for multiple versions.

It is also possible to write and save generic patches in `patches/generic/`
subdirectory of the artifact definition directory. These patches are applied for
all versions of the artifact. This can be useful for example to create an
additional file in artifact source tree, without need to maintain the same patch
for multiple versions.

The patches are assembled into a serie by Fatbuildr and integrated in the source
packages (SRPM or dsc). They are applied by respective build tools at the
beginning of the build phase.

Generic patches are applied before version specific patches. When multiples
patches are present in a subdirectory, they are applied in lexicographic order.

Even if it is not a requirement, it is recommended to fill header of patches
files with metadata in {deb822-man}[deb822 format], following {dep-3}[Debian
DEP-3] patch tagging guidelines. In particular, these fields are particulary
useful to help maintainance of patches over time:

> * `Description`: This […] field contains at least a short description on the
>    first line, […] it allows for a more verbose explanation of the patch and
>    its history. This field should explain why the patch is vendor-specific
>    (ex: branding patch) when that is the case. If the patch has been submitted
>    upstream but has been rejected, the description should also document why
>    it's kept and what were the reasons for the reject.
> * `Last-Update`: This field can be used to record the date when the
>    meta-information was last updated. It should use the ISO date format
>    YYYY-MM-DD.
> * `Forwarded`: Any value other than "no" or "not-needed" means that the patch
>    has been forwarded upstream. Ideally the value is an URL proving that it
>    has been forwarded and where one can find more information about its
>    inclusion status. If the field is missing, its implicit value is "yes" if
>    the "Bug" field is present, otherwise it's "no". The field is really
>    required only if the patch is vendor specific, in that case its value
>    should be "not-needed" to indicate that the patch must not be forwarded
>    upstream (whereas "no" simply means that it has not yet been done).
> * `Author`: This field can be used to record the name and email of the patch
>    author (ex: "John Bear <foo@example.com>"). […] It's also a good idea to
>    add this contact information when the patch needs to be maintained over
>    time because it has very little chance of being integrated upstream. This
>    field can be used multiple times if several people authored the patch.

_Source: {dep-3}[Debian DEP-3]_

Additionally to these standard fields, Fatbuildr supports the following custom
fields:

* `Distributions`: This field can be used to restrict patch application to
  specific distributions. For example, the value `Distributions: el8 el9` makes
  the patch apply during builds targeting _el8_ and _el9_ distributions only.
* `Formats`: This field can be used to restrict patch application to specific
  artifact format. For example, the value `Formats: deb` makes the patch apply
  during builds of deb packages only.
* `Template`: When set to `yes`, Fatbuildr considers this patch as a
  {j2-template}[Jinja2 template] to process. The following variables are
  available in the template:

include::partial$version-var.adoc[]

The xref:fatbuildrctl.adoc[] `patches` command provides a convenient way to
maintain artifact patches subdirectory using Git version control system. It
manages the files names, patches metadata and ensure patches are properly
formatted without offset or context error.

With this command, the git commit messages are significant. The first line of
the message is the resulting filename of the patch in the artifact definition
tree, without the index prefix (_ex:_ `0001-`) and the `.patch` suffix.
Fatbuildr expects to find {dep-3}[Debian DEP-3] metadata in the other lines of
the commit message.

NOTE: The `Author` field is automatically generated by `fatbuildrctl patches`
when exporting patches based on the author of the corresponding Git commit.
During patches import in Git repository history, the `Author` field is extracted
from patch header to set the author of the commit.

The following field can also be defined in Git commit messages:

* `Generic`: When set to `yes`, Fatbuildr exports this patch in the
  `patches/generic/` subdirectory, instead of version specific subdirectory.
  This way, the patch is applied for all upstream versions of the artifact.
  In the other way, `fatbuildrctl patches` defines this field in commit messages
  for all patches imported from the `patches/generic/` subdirectory.

[#prescript]
=== Prescript

The artifact definition directory can contain a script file named
`pre.sh`, referred as the artifact _prescript_. This _prescript_ is actually
executed by Fatbuildr at build time, before the actual artifact build, in the
targeted build environment, inside the artifact source tree. For more details
about the functional aspects of _prescripts_, please refer to
xref:overview:features.adoc#prescripts[_prescript_ feature description].

WARNING: Artifact prescripts are used only for Deb and RPM packages artifact
formats.

The _prescript_ must be a valid bash (_Bourne Again SHell_) script.

NOTE: The `#!/bin/bash` shebang is not required, although it is recommended
because it gives hint to text editor and other tools guessing the file format,
typically for syntax highlighting.

The prescript is executed in the source tree with xref:#patches[artifact
patches] applied, if present.

As opposed to the actual build phase, the prescript get access to external
networks and potentially Internet if permitted by your network policy.

Some bash functions are available in prescripts:

`DL`:: Download HTTP URL and save file. The first argument is the URL, the
second argument is the relative path to the saved file in the source tree.
+
--
Exemple:

[source,bash]
----
DL https://host/bootstrap.min.css assets/bootstrap.min.css
----
--

Prescript rules can be declared in comments:

`#PRESCRIPT_DEPS`:: A space separated list of packages to install temporarily in
the build environment before running the prescript. This list of packages is
concatenated with the basic set of prescript dependencies declared in main
Fatbuildr configuration file.

TIP: Fatbuildr supports installation of DNF modules as prescript dependencies
when building RPM packages. The module names must be specified with `module:`
prefix in the list of packages.

`#PRESCRIPT_TARBALLS`:: A space separated list of subdirectories used to
generate supplementary tarballs for the artifact.

When `#PRESCRIPT_TARBALLS` rule is not defined, Fatbuildr generates a patch with
all modifications performed by the prescript after its execution. This patch is
automatically integrated in the source package, after the potential assembled
serie of xref:#patches[artifact patches].

When `#PRESCRIPT_TARBALLS` rule is defined, Fatbuildr generates supplementary
tarballs with the content of the provided subdirectories, after prescript
execution. One supplementary tarball is generated per subdirectory. These
supplementary tarballs are then used in combination with the main upstream
source tarball to compose the initial source tree of the package.

Generally, supplementary tarballs should be preferred over the patch approach
when the prescript modifications are quite large (over 1k lines of
modification).

Supplementary tarballs are the only solution to apply binary blob modification
on upstream source tarball, as it is not supported in standard patches format.

NOTE: The subdirectories used for supplementary tarballs are actually renamed
by Fatbuildr to get unique names. This renaming is performed to avoid
conflict in packages repositories with previously generated supplementary
tarballs and potentially different content. The unique names are composed of the
build timestamp and part of the build task ID. Symlinks from the initial name to
the unique name are installed by Fatbuildr with an additional patch integrated
in the source package, then packaging code can rely on initial names without
impact.

[TIP]
====
It is possible to define distribution and format specific values of prescript
rules, with `@distributions:<dists>` and `@formats:<formats>` suffixes
respectively. The matching distributions and formats are specified as a
comma-separated list of values.

This distribution specific value takes precedence over the format specific
value, which takes precedence over the generic value. Only the first matching
rule is considered.
====

Exemple 1::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

mkdir assets
DL https://host/bootstrap.min.css assets/bootstrap.min.css
----

In this example, the `DL` function is used to download CSS file on external host
and save this file in a new `assets/` subdirectory. As the `#PRETARBALLS` rule
is not defined, a patch will be generated by Fatbuildr and integrated in source
package patches serie to install the `assets/` subdirectory with the CSS file.
--

Example 2::
+
--
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

#PRESCRIPT_DEPS@distributions:el8,el9 rpm-build-golang module:python:39
#PRESCRIPT_DEPS@format:deb dh-golang
#PRESCRIPT_DEPS golang
#PRESCRIPT_TARBALLS vendor

mkdir vendor
go mod vendor
----

In this example:

* `rpm-build-golang` package and `python:39` module are temporarily installed by
  Fatbuildr in build environments for _el8_ and _el9_ distributions.
* `dh-golang` package is installed in build environments for _deb_ format.
* `golang` in other build environments.

Then, `go` command is used to do _vendoring_ of all dependencies. After the

== Template filters

Additionally to
https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/#builtin-filters[Jinja2
built-in filters], Fatbuildr also provides some filters available to use in your
templates:

[cols="1u,3a"]

|Name|Description

|`gittag`
| Replace in a string characters disallowed in Git tags. For reference, see
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ref-format[`git check-ref-format` manpage].
It is notably useful to transform a complex version number into a valid Git tag
in tarball URL.

_Ex:_ `1.2.3~beta1` → `1.2.3-beta1`

|`rpm_version`
| Replace in a string illegal characters in RPM spec Version field. More
specifically, it replaces `-` by `~`.

_Ex:_ `1.2-0rc1` → `1.2~0rc1`

|`timestamp_rpmdate`
| Transform an integer timestamp into a date formatted as expected for RPM spec
changelog.

_Ex:_ `949547106` → `Thu Feb 03 2000`

|`timestamp_iso`
| Transform an integer timestamp into a date in ISO format.

_Ex:_ `949547106` → `2000-02-03 04:05:06`
