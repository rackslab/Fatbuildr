= What is Fatbuildr?

Fatbuildr is a fully-featured xref:continuous_delivery.adoc[continuous delivery]
solution for GNU/Linux software environment. It builds software artifacts (ex:
rpm/deb packages, containers) by following instructions described in
user-provided _artifact definitions_.

Fatbuildr manages all the complexity of secured software distribution:

* Publication of artifacts in standards registries (ex: APT/DNF repositories)
* Digital signatures of artifacts with secured cryptographic keys
* Automatic removal of deprecated artifacts
* Clean and updated build environments
* Support of multiple hardware architectures (ex: ARM, x86_64)

Fatbuildr can help organizations to:

* Maintain a set of sofware artifacts with high-level of quality and consistency
* Fully-adopt the best integration guidelines defined by the Linux distribution community
* Control and manage software dependencies for all targeted environments
* Check software compatibility with supported environments
* Get reproducible builds

Fatbuildr uses xref:architecture.adoc#components[multiple components
architecture] to provide both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web
interface. It also provides a secure xref:usage:api.adoc[REST API] for
integration with other tools.

It integrates the best-in-class tools developed by the free software community
to manage Linux based build environments (ex: cowbuilder, mock) with help of
xref:architecture.adoc#containers[Linux containers].

All the operations are realized in the form of
xref:architecture.adoc#tasks[generic _tasks_]. Tasks can perform various set of
actions involved in software distribution (ex: build artifact, update build
environment, create signing key, etc). All tasks operations are recorded and
saved centrally for the purposes of accounting and observability.

One installation of Fatbuildr can support
xref:architecture.adoc#instances[multiples instances] in parallel. Each instance
has its own set of build pipelines, keyring, registries, tasks, etc. It makes
easy to define independent setups for developement, staging or production.

Fatbuildr currently supports the following artifacts formats:

* RPM packages
* Deb packages
* https://github.com/systemd/mkosi[OSI] images

The software is fully modular and extensible, more supported formats can be
easily added.

Fatbuildr is designed to run in environments of all sizes, from developers'
laptop to test local builds, to high-grade entreprise on-premise servers for
centralized builds of a large developers team distributing software for large
scale IT infrastructure.
