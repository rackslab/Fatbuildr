[#interface]
== Listening interface and port

CAUTION: These instructions are valid only for Fatbuildrweb running as an
xref:install:web.adoc#autonomous[autonomous service]. Please refer to your HTTP
server reference documentation to control this setting for Fatbuildrweb running
as a xref:install:web.adoc#wsgi[WSGI application].

By default, Fatbuildrweb autonomous service listens on _localhost_ interface and
port TCP/5000.

Edit Fatbuildr site configuration file `/etc/fatbuildr/fatbuildr.ini`. If not
already present, add `[web]` section.

In this section, define parameter `host` with the host IP address to which
Fatbuildrweb should bind its socket listening for incoming connections. Special
value `0.0.0.0` means _all_ network interfaces.

The TCP port can also be changed with `port` parameter (ex: `1234``).

For example:

[source,ini]
----
[web]
host = 0.0.0.0
port = 1234
----

To apply the settings, restart the service:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl restart fatbuildrweb.service
----

Please refer to xref:conf.adoc#parameters[configuration parameters reference
documentation] for full details about available parameters.

[NOTE]
====
Binding network socket to priviled ports <= 1024 (_ex:_ 80/HTTP) requires
`CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` Linux capability. By default, only the _root_ user has
this capability. Fatbuildrweb autonomous service can be given this capability
with a systemd _drop-in_ unit configuration file for `fatbuildrweb.service`.

First create service _drop-in_ directory:

[source,shell]
----
# mkdir /etc/systemd/system/fatbuildrweb.service.d
----

Create configuration file in this directory (_ex:_
`/etc/systemd/system/fatbuildrweb.service.d/net-bind-cap.conf`) with this
parameter:

[source,ini]
----
[Service]
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
----

Make systemd reload unit configuration files:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl daemon-reload
----

Edit Fatbuildr site configuration file `/etc/fatbuildr/fatbuildr.ini` to setup
the port value below 1024 (ex: 80/HTTP), and apply the configuration by
restarting the service:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl restart fatbuildrweb.service
----
====

[#monoinstance]
== Mono-instance mode

By default, Fatbuildrweb is setup in multi-instances modes, it serves all
instances defined in Fatbuildr installation. This can be changed to serve one
specific instance and remove instance name in URL paths.

This feature can typically be used to serve instances behind their specific
Apache2 virtual hosts or nginx sites with their dedicated network server names
(ex: `prod.example.org` and `staging.example.org`).

=== Autonomous Service

Edit Fatbuildr site configuration file `/etc/fatbuildr/fatbuildr.ini`. If not
already present, add `[web]` section.

In this section, define parameter `instance` with the name of the Fatbuildr
instance to serve. For example:

[source,ini]
----
[web]
instance = prod
----

Apply the new configuration by restarting the service:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl restart fatbuildrweb.service
----

=== WSGI Application

Settings of WSGI application depends on the HTTP server and the WSGI module.
The following subsections provides configuration instructions for some
combinations of those.

NOTE: If you need help to setup Fatbuildrweb as a WSGI application in
mono-instance mode with a different combination of HTTP server and WSGI module,
please https://github.com/rackslab/fatbuildr/issues/new[open an issue]. If you
want to contribute documentation for an additional HTTP server or WSGI module,
please https://github.com/rackslab/fatbuildr/compare[open a pull request]!

==== Apache2 and `mod_wsgi`

Edit the configuration snippet used to xref:install:web.adoc#wsgi-apache[declare
Fatbuildr WSGI application] in Apache2 HTTP server configuration file to modify
the first argument of the `WSGIDaemonProcess` directive:

[source,diff]
----
--- a/site.conf
+++ b/site.conf
@@ -1,4 +1,4 @@
-WSGIDaemonProcess fatbuildrweb-all user=fatbuildr group=fatbuildr locale=en_US.UTF-8
+WSGIDaemonProcess fatbuildrweb-prod user=fatbuildr group=fatbuildr locale=en_US.UTF-8
 WSGIScriptAlias / /usr/share/fatbuildr/wsgi/fatbuildrweb.wsgi
 WSGIPassAuthorization On
----

The `-all` special suffix value enables _multi-instances mode_. For example, to
setup _mono-instance mode_ on the  _prod_ instance, replace the `-all` suffix by
`-prod`.

Finally reload the Apache2 HTTP service to enable modifications:

* On Debian/Ubuntu:
+
[source,shell]
----
# systemctl reload apache2.service
----

* On RHEL:
+
[source,shell]
----
# systemctl reload httpd.service
----

==== Nginx and uWSGI

Edit Fatbuildr uWSGI service file
`/etc/systemd/system/fatbuildrweb-uwsgi.service`, as deployed in
xref:install:web.adoc#wsgi-nginx[corresponding installation guide], to append
the targeted instance name in executable argument:

----

For example, to setup _mono-instance mode_ on the _prod_ instance, append
`--pyargv=prod` argument. The default value of the `pyargv` parameter is _all_,
it is defined in the INI file and it enables _multi-instances mode_.

Finally restart the service to apply changes:

[source,shell]
----
# systemctl restart fatbuildrweb-uwsgi.service
----

[#policy]
== Access Policy

[#policy-def]
=== Policy definition files

The permissions to access Fatbuildrweb HTML and REST API endpoints are defined
by a policy. By default, the vendor policy is defined in file
`/usr/share/fatbuildr/web/policy.acl`. This default policy can be overriden with
a site policy by creating a file `/etc/fatbuildr/web/policy.acl`.

CAUTION: Do not modify the vendor policy file or your modifications can be lost
at the next Fatbuildr package upgrade.

NOTE: The paths to the policy files can be changed in xref:conf.adoc[Fatbuildr
system configuration file].

The policy files have the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file[INI file
format], with sections and parameters.

A policy file must have a global `[roles]` section. The options of this section
are the names of the roles involved in the policy. The values of all options
except the `anonymous` role are a comma-separated list of role members. The list
can contain invidual users or group names prefixed by `@`.

NOTE: Fatbuildr only supports
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch[UNIX NSS backend] for
retrieving users and groups. If users and groups of your organization are
defined in an LDAP directory or SQL database, you must setup a NSS source (eg.
https://sssd.io/[sssd]) to make the users and groups available to Fatbuildr.

.Example of role members:
====
[source,ini]
----
[roles]
users=@devs,john
----

This policy defines the _users_ role whose members are the individual user
_john_ and the members of _devs_ group.
====

For each declared role, a section must be defined with the `actions` option. The
value of this option is comma-separated of _permission actions_ allowed to this
role. This list can also contain values prefixed by `@` followed by a role name
to include the actions allowed to another role. This makes simple to define a
role as an extension of another role.

.Example of role actions:
====
[source,ini]
----
[roles]
users=@devs,john
admins=mary

[users]
actions=view-task

[admins]
actions=@users,view-keyring
----

This policy defines 2 roles _users_ and _admins_. The _users_ role is allowed to
perform the _view-task_ action. The _admins_ is allowed to perform actions
allowed to _users_ role and the _view-keyring_ action.
====

TIP: When the _anonymous_ role is declared with allowed actions, all other roles
are automatically allowed to perform these actions.

.Vendor policy
[%collapsible]
====
For reference, here is the content of the default vendor policy file:

[source,ini]
----
include::example$policy.acl[lines=10..-1]
----
====

[#perms]
=== Permission actions

Fatbuildrweb supports the following _permission actions_:

[cols="1m,3"]
|===
|Name|Description

|view-pipeline
|View content instance pipelines definition

|view-registry
|View content of artifact registries

|view-task
|View tasks queue (running and pending), archives and outputs

|view-keyring
|Get information about keyring public key

|build
|Submit build tasks
|===

== Custom HTML templates

The HTML pages served by Fatbuildrweb are rendered based on templates. Fatbuildr
provides vendor templates installed in directory
`/usr/share/fatbuildr/web/templates`.

All these vendor templates can be individually overriden by site custom
templates.

NOTE: By default, Fatbuildr searches for custom site rendered templates in
directory `/etc/fatbuildr/web/templates` but this can be changed by setting
another value to `templates` parameter in `[web]` section of site configuration
file. Please refer to xref:conf.adoc#parameters[configuration parameters
reference documentation] for full details about available parameters.

For example, this feature can be used to add a link in the footer of all HTML
pages.

First, copy the corresponding vendor template in template site directory:

[source,shell]
----
# mkdir /etc/fatbuildr/web/templates/layout
# cp /usr/share/fatbuildr/web/templates/layout/base.html.j2 \
     /etc/fatbuildr/web/templates/layout
----

Edit the new file, for example:

[source,diff]
----
--- /usr/share/fatbuildr/web/templates/layout/base.html.j2
+++ /etc/fatbuildr/web/templates/layout/base.html.j2
